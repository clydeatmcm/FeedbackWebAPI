# SQL Server and C# Web API Demo

### Overview
This demo showcases how to implement database functionality in a Unity application using SQL Server and C#. It provides an alternative to the traditional PHP and MySQL approach.

### Features
* Web API: Connects Unity with SQL Server.
* Data Handling: Easily add, retrieve, and manage database records.
* Unity Integration: Simple setup for use in Unity projects.

### Requirements
* SQL Server
* .NET Framework (version X.X)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Set Up SQL Server: Create a database and configure your connection string in the project.

3. Run the Web API: Start the Web API service.

4. Test the Integration (not yet included, repo will be updated sooner): Use provided scripts in Unity to test database interactions.

### Usage
* Follow the example scripts to learn how to perform CRUD operations.
* Customize the API endpoints as needed for your project.
